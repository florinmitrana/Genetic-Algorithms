# Genetic-Algorithms

**This project employs genetic algorithms to solve optimization problems efficiently.Genetic algorithms mimic the process of natural selection to evolve solutions.The algorithm starts with a population of random solutions and iteratively evolves them using selection, crossover, and mutation operations. This repository contains the implementation of genetic algorithms along with examples demonstrating their application to various optimization tasks.**

# Features:
